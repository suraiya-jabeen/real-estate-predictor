# Real Estate Price Prediction App

This project is a real estate price prediction application built with **React** and **Brain.js** for neural network predictions. The app allows users to input details about a property (such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and age) and get a predicted price for that property based on a trained neural network.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more details, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All other commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don't have to eject unless you need full control over the configuration files.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-predictor.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd real-estate-predictor
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Run the app:

bash
Copy
npm start
The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Neural Network
This project uses Brain.js, a neural network library for JavaScript. The neural network is trained on preprocessed real estate data and used to predict property prices based on user inputs.

Features:
Neural Network Prediction: Based on inputs like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and property age, the app uses a neural network to predict the price of a property.
Input Normalization: Data is normalized before being fed into the neural network to improve accuracy.
One-hot Encoding: The location is encoded as a one-hot vector (Downtown, Suburban, or Rural) for the neural network to process.
Neural Network Configuration:
The neural network is configured and trained using preprocessed real estate data. For more details, see the neuralNetwork.js file.

### Key Changes:
1. **Project Context**: Updated the README to reflect the purpose of the app (real estate price prediction).
2. **Instructions**: Instructions were added for setting up and running the app locally.
3. **Neural Network**: Clarified the use of **Brain.js** for neural network predictions.
4. **Dependencies**: The `npm install` and `npm start` steps are explained for getting the app running locally.
5. **Learning Resources**: Links to relevant documentation for **React** and **Brain.js** are included.
6. **License**: An MIT license section has been added as a placeholder; you can adjust this according to your actual license.
