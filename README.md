# Real Estate Price Prediction App

This project is a real estate price prediction application built with **React** and **Brain.js** for neural network predictions. The app allows users to input details about a property (such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and age) and get a predicted price for that property based on a trained neural network.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suraiya-jabeen/real-estate-predictor.git

>>>>>>> 53b74af (Updated README.md with project details and deployment instructions)
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd real-estate-predictor
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Run the app:

bash
Copy
npm start
The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Neural Network
This project uses Brain.js, a neural network library for JavaScript. The neural network is trained on preprocessed real estate data and used to predict property prices based on user inputs.

Features:
Neural Network Prediction: Based on inputs like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and property age, the app uses a neural network to predict the price of a property.
Input Normalization: Data is normalized before being fed into the neural network to improve accuracy.
One-hot Encoding: The location is encoded as a one-hot vector (Downtown, Suburban, or Rural) for the neural network to process.
Neural Network Configuration:
The neural network is configured and trained using preprocessed real estate data. For more details, see the neuralNetwork.js file.
